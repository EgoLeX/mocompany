> How to use

I recommend to use Visual Studio to continue this project.

After downloading the release you can easily open the project by double click the ".sln"-file in main folder.


> Legal

You can modify or finish this tool and publish it under your name. 
But you need to name the following people if you use parts of their creation:
- Kartoffelphantom (images of bus depots)
- Jockie (repaints for busses in Ã¶pnv store)
